# Toggl but a bit better

I found it hard to use toggl's UI for bulk updating stuff (as a user and not an admin), so I thought i'd write my own lightweight wrapper around their API. 

Work in progress. 


## Getting started 

create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
API_PASS=api_token
API_URL=https://www.toggl.com
```

`npm install`

`npm start`

`open http://localhost:3000/`
